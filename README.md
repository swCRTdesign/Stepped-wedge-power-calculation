# Stepped-wedge-power-calculation
Code for a Shiny app to calculate power for Stepped Wedge trials.

The app can be run directly from https://swcrtdesign.shinyapps.io/stepped_wedge_power_calculation/.  To run the app locally, download the R file and the 'manual_markdown' file.  Make sure they are saved in the same folder or location.  After installing all required packages, run the Shiny app (e.g. in RStudio, press the 'Run App' button).  See https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/ for details.

The files labeled "filename_v1" correspond to the app that was available online until January 31st, 2023.  The files without an extension correspond to the app that is currently online.  The updates made on January 31st, 2023 consist mainly of extending the app to calculate power for a model that allows the treatment effect to vary with exposure time; see help file.
